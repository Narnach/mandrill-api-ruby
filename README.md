# mandrill-api-ruby

This is a fork of [Brian Glusman's fork](https://github.com/stellaservice/mandrill-api-ruby) or the official [Mandrill API wrapper](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-ruby).

Why do we need this fork? Because Mailchimp published a Ruby gem API wrapper, points to it in their [official documentation](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/index.ruby.html), but stopped maintaining the code in [2014](https://rubygems.org/gems/mandrill-api). The official listed JSON dependency is now an active security vulnerability, so it should not be used anymore.

This fork is simply to have a snapshot of the code rather than blindly including unreviewed code in our projects.
